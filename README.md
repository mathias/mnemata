# mnemata

A Hoplon project with Foundation for CSS (and its friends Bower and Grunt to compile the SCSS)

## Dependencies

- java 1.7+
- [boot][1]
- [leiningen][2]
- bower, grunt-cli

## Usage

You'll probably want to have two (or more) terminals open in your project's
directory.

1. Start the auto-compiler.

```bash
$ boot watch hoplon
```

2. Compile the scss if you haven't yet:

```bash
$ grunt
```

2. Open the compiled html file.

```bash
$ open resources/public/index.html
```

3. You're already done.
